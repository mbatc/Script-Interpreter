# Script-Interpreter
This is a Script Interpreter that I wrote as a bit of a learning experience

Almost of the code in this system was made up as i went along. I had a general idea of how an interpreter or compiler worked, but i didn't really know how to write it. So basically this system works but it may not be that great.

Also I am terrible at commenting code so have fun trying to figure out what is going on.
